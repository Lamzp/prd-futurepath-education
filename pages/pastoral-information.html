                    </h3>
                    <p class="our-manifesto__desc desc-system">To ease parents' concerns about their
                        children's safety while they
                        are with us, all of our team members will be required to undergo an extensive DBS check (the
                        UK's criminal record check) and go through safeguarding and welfare training. We place a high
                        emphasis on the security and welfare of our participants. Every participant in a Futurepath
                        program is placed in a group guided by a mentor; this group typically consists of 9–10 students
                        and is supervised by an on-site Futurepath Education Mentor.</p>
                    <p class="our-manifesto__desc desc-system">All participants can depend on mentors for friendship,
                        support, and
                        guidance. They are willing to share their knowledge and experience and have a genuine
                        understanding of the difficulties and demands that participants must deal with. But most
                        importantly, they should be able to support the student and serve as a channel for communication
                        between the team and the student at any and all times. Since many mentors are former students of
                        Brunel University or Futurepath, they can link their experiences to each participant. </p>
